# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a dedicated contact/order form page to SubliCraft Studio where visitors can reach out or place orders online.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a new Contact/Order page with a form that includes fields for name, email, message, and order details (e.g., product type, quantity, customization notes)
- Add navigation link to the new Contact/Order page in the site's navigation
- Wire form submission to the backend (store submissions in the main Motoko actor)

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors can navigate to a Contact/Order page and submit an inquiry or order request through an online form.
