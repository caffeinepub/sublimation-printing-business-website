  "summary": "The build request asks to add an online contact/order form page with no explicit requirements or acceptance criteria listed. The diff shows modifications to ContactSection.tsx, frontend-file-summaries.txt, and project_state.json, which implement a contact/order inquiry form. Since no specific requirements or acceptance criteria were defined, there is nothing formally missing or hallucinated relative to the spec.",
